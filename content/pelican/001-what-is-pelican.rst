Starting a Pelican Site
=======================

First, create a directory for the project, remmember to choose a apropriate name:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir -p ~/projects/pelican-powered-site
    cd ~/projects/pelican-powered-site

    pelican-quickstart

Some questions are going to ask to pre-configure the site.

Creating a Article
==================

Before run pelican we need to ad some content to our site. Using one text editor wite this down:

.. code-block:: shell

    Title: My First Review
    Date: 2010-12-03 10:20
    Category: Review

    Following is a review of my favorite mechanical keyboard.

The example article is written in Markdown syntax. Save the file in:

.. code-block:: shell

    ~/projects/pelican-powered-site/content/keyboard-review.md

Generating and running the site
===============================

From the site's directory run this command to generate our site:

.. code-block:: shell

    pelican content

After the command end all site files has been generated inside "output" folder. To preview it execute:

.. code-block:: shell

    cd ~/projects/pelican-powered-site/output
    python -m pelican.server

That's all Folks!! Now we got a static site generated with one simple article.
